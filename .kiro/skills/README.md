# FastMCP Skills for Snowflake MCP Server

## Essential Patterns for Hackathon Success

### 1. **Tool Patterns** (CRITICAL)
- Basic Snowflake query tools
- Context integration for logging
- Flask chart generation tools
- Error handling patterns

### 2. **Project Structure** (CRITICAL) 
- DRY principle with common.py
- Dual-mode: main.py vs main_noauth.py
- Clean separation: tools/, resources/, tests/

### 3. **Basic Testing** (IMPORTANT)
- FastMCP Client testing
- Unit tests for tools
- Integration tests

## What We DON'T Need for Hackathon:
- ❌ OAuth (Kiro CLI doesn't need it)
- ❌ Complex resource patterns (simple is better)
- ❌ Advanced authentication

## Focus Areas for Scoring:
- **Application Quality (40%)**: Working Snowflake queries + Flask charts
- **Kiro CLI Usage (20%)**: Custom prompts and workflow
- **Documentation (20%)**: README + DEVLOG
- **Innovation (15%)**: Natural language + visualization
- **Presentation (5%)**: Demo video

## Key Takeaway:
**Keep it simple and working** rather than over-engineering with features we don't need!
